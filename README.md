- **Batch Processing:** Handle large volumes of documents efficiently.

### 2. Intelligent Classification
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Automatically categorize documents based on content and metadata.
- **Customizable Classification Models:** Adapt to different document types and categories.

### 3. Secure Storage
- **Encrypted Cloud Storage:** Ensures that documents are stored safely and securely.
- **Redundant Backup:** Protects against data loss with automatic backups.

### 4. Efficient Retrieval
- **Robust Search Engine:** Allows quick search and retrieval of documents using various criteria.
- **Advanced Query Options:** Supports keyword searches, metadata searches, and more.

### 5. Access Control and Compliance
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Manages user permissions based on roles.
- **Compliance Tracking:** Ensures adherence to legal standards and regulations for document handling.

### 6. Version Control
- **Document Revision Tracking:** Monitors changes and updates to documents.
- **Rollback Capability:** Allows reverting to previous versions when necessary.
